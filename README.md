# Bash Essentials

## Overview
I followed along with [this Bash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrfwcbYJZfc&list=PLlrxD0HtieHh9ZhrnEbZKhzk0cetzuX7l) on Microsoft Developer’s YouTube series, which introduces Bash as a universal language widely used in cloud computing and programming. Bash enables command-based interaction with your environment, supported by many programming languages and essential for cloud platform interactions. 

### Course Focus
While it didn’t cover every aspect of Bash, this course provided a strong foundation in Bash scripting, allowing me to automate tasks, create scripts, and manage systems efficiently.

### Key Learnings
- **Terminal Basics**: Navigating and using commands in the Bash terminal.
- **File Management**: Manipulating files and directories, from creating to organizing.
- **Scripts & Automation**: Writing Bash scripts and understanding variables, conditions, functions, and loops.
- **Permissions & Security**: Modifying file permissions and using redirection and pipelines.
  
### Practical Knowledge Gained

Here are the practical commands and concepts covered in the course:

1. **Navigation**
   - `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`
2. **File/Directory Operations**
   - `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `touch`
3. **File Viewing**
   - `cat`, `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `nano`, `vim`
4. **Permissions**
   - `chmod`, `chown`
5. **Search & Find**
   - `find`, `locate`, `grep`
6. **System Info**
   - `uname`, `df`, `du`, `top`, `ps`
7. **Networking**
   - `ping`, `ifconfig`, `wget`, `curl`, `ssh`
8. **Compression**
   - `tar`, `gzip`, `unzip`
9. **Redirection & Pipes**
   - `>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`
10. **Environment Variables**
    - `export`, `printenv`, `env`
11. **Process Management**
    - `kill`, `pkill`, `killall`
12. **Command History & Aliases**
    - `history`, `alias`, `unalias`

## Prerequisites
- **Accounts Needed**: GitHub and Azure (only needed for the last video).
- **Tools**: GitHub Codespaces (for GitHub-based editing) for an optimized learning experience.

By the end of this course, I learned to manage files, navigate directories, automate tasks, and handle permissions with Bash, building confidence to take on more complex Bash scripting projects.
