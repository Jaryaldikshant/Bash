What is Bash Script

Bash Script is a file that contains one or more commands that is meant to be executed within your bash shell


Shebang(#!) : used to specify the interpreter that should execute the file 

Without a shebang, you would need to manually specify the interpreter every time you run the script, e.g., bash script.sh 

With a shebang, you can make the script executable, and the system will automatically use the specified interpreter when you run it with ./script.sh. 

# : these are the called Comments and are used to document your scripts, provide clarity in context to what youâ€™re creating here.


To run a script directly by just typing its filename, you need to make sure the script is executable and is located in a directory that is part of your PATH environment variable 

If we want to run the Bash file we first need give permission to that file, then we can use ./filename to run the file , but if we want to run using filename only then we need echo $PATH to see the path then need to make directory and sub directory use mkdir -p /home/vscode/.local/bin this will make a local directory in the vscode directory and bin sub directory in the local, then we need to copy the file into that directory cp hello_world /home/vscode/.local/bin, only then we can run using filename only
